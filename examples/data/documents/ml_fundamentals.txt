Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve 
from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms and statistical models 
to identify patterns in data.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled training data. Common algorithms include 
linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The model discovers patterns in unlabeled data. Clustering and 
dimensionality reduction are common unsupervised tasks.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns through interaction with an environment, receiving 
rewards or penalties for actions.

Applications:

- Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection, facial recognition
- Natural Language Processing: Sentiment analysis, machine translation, text classification
- Recommendation Systems: Netflix recommendations, Amazon product suggestions
- Predictive Analytics: Stock price forecasting, demand prediction

Workflow:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize data
3. Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features
4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithm
5. Training: Fit model to training data
6. Evaluation: Assess performance on test data
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters
8. Deployment: Put model into production
