Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with 
multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in large amounts of data.

Neural Network Architecture:

- Input Layer: Receives input features
- Hidden Layers: Perform transformations and feature extraction
- Output Layer: Produces final predictions
- Weights and Biases: Learnable parameters adjusted during training

Common Architectures:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Specialized for image processing, uses convolutional layers 
to automatically detect spatial features.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Handles sequential data like time series and text, maintains 
hidden state to capture temporal dependencies.

3. Transformer Networks: Based on self-attention mechanism, enables parallel processing of sequences, 
used in modern NLP (BERT, GPT).

Training Process:

1. Forward Pass: Input flows through network producing output
2. Loss Calculation: Compare output to ground truth
3. Backward Pass: Compute gradients using backpropagation
4. Parameter Update: Adjust weights using gradient descent optimizer

Popular Frameworks:

- TensorFlow: Google's framework with Keras high-level API
- PyTorch: Facebook's framework known for research flexibility
- JAX: Numerical computing library with automatic differentiation

Challenges:

- Requires large amounts of labeled data
- Computationally expensive (GPUs/TPUs needed)
- Difficult to interpret decisions (black box)
- Prone to overfitting on small datasets
